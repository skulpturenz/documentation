Identity services are a fundamental requirement of every modern web application. 

Self-hosting is not a necessity, there are numerous Identity as a Service solutions available such as Auth0, Firebase, Okta, Cognito and Ory. As for self hosted solutions, the most prominent ones include: Keycloak, IdentityServer, Authentik and Authelia.

Goals:
1. Data ownership
2. Scalability and cost: ability to scale with a relatively flat cost curve
3. Integration
4. Multi-tenancy: different realms for different apps
5. Stability 

In light of these requirements, Keycloak was chosen because:
1. Stability: a CNCF incubation project and has been under active development as an OSS project for the past decade
2. Data ownership
3. Customisability: keycloakify for user facing customisation, worst case forking keycloakify or FreeMarker

Sessions need to be sticky and NGINX caches IP addresses of services if we donâ€™t refer to the Docker Swarm LB so NGINX has to be restarted each time = deployments are not zero down time

`kamal-proxy` available but it does not do load balancing (on the TODO)

authnz-service-proxy to put in front of anything that needs to be authenticated. function: keep redirecting to `authnz` until authenticated.
