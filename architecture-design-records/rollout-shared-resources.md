## Introduction & goals
### Requirements
Feature flagging enable trunk-based development, allowing shorter release cycles and reducing risk by aiding in gradual rollout of new functionality to a smaller sample of users which reduces the scale and severity of issues.

The most popular platforms for feature flags include:
- [LaunchDarkly](https://launchdarkly.com)
- [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io)
- [Flipt](https://www.flipt.io)

### Quality goals (TODO)
